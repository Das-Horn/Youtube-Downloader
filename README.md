# Youtube-Downloader
This is a rewrite for my previous application for downloading youtube videos.
inside of the folder V1 is the previous application
inside of V2 is the rewrite I have completed.
The rewrite contains a much better ui and better progress tracking. I am currently putting this project on hold for now as the api it is dependent on doesn't work most of the time now. If i find a more reliable source in the future I will try to implement it.
